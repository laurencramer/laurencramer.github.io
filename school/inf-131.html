				<h3>About</h3>
					<p>We chose to redesign <a href="https://www.reddit.com/" title="Reddit" target="_blank" class="schoolLink">Reddit</a> in an effort to make the user interface more modern, more efficient, and design-oriented. The current interface was overwhelming and daunting to the average, inexperienced, or new user. Updating the interface would make the site more welcoming to newer users while keeping the functionality that expert or experienced users desire.
					</p>
					<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> This project was completed prior to Reddit's redesign in April of 2018.</p>
				<h3>Our Goals</h3>
					<p>
					<strong>Effectiveness</strong>: Reddit effectively acts as a platform for user-submitted content. Users are able to
					make posts, discuss, and view content, as that is purpose of the interface.<br><br>
					<strong>Efficieny</strong>: 
					Reddit is efficient for casual to expert users but seems inefficient for infrequent or
					new users. There are many features to streamline the process but these features are
					hard to discover. Once users surpass the learning curve and master the site’s features,
					it becomes relatively easy to navigate the site. For example, the large amount of
					content displayed per page uses up the screen space efficiently for frequent users but
					is a bit overwhelming for newer users who are not used to these features.<br><br>
					<strong>Utility</strong>: 
					Reddit provides the tools needed to make posts, discuss, and view content. There
					are clearly marked buttons redirecting the user to a dedicated interface for each of
					these tasks.<br><br>
					<strong>Learnability</strong>: 
					Reddit has a steep learning curve due to its complexity. Sign-up is required for
					guidance and the provided guidance is still relatively unclear and unhelpful.
