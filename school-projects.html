		<h3>Project in Human-Computer Interaction Requirements and Evaluation (2018 - 10 weeks)</h3>
			<p>
			<strong>Course objective: </strong>Students undertake significant projects in the elicitation and specification of HCI requirements and the thorough evaluation of user interfaces.
			<br><br>
			<strong>The project: </strong> The purpose of this project was to provide an in-depth analysis and evaluation of an application, and we chose <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.urbandroid.sleep&hl=en_US" class="schoolLink" title="Sleep as Android Google Play Store" target="_blank">Sleep as Android</a>. This project required extensive research done in verifying the usability of Sleep as Android along with its many features. It aims to provide validity to the proposed changes of the application through competitor and user research, user testing, and evaluation of potential redesigns for the key features identified through the research.
