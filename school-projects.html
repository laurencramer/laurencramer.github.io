      <h1>Project Courses - UCI</h1>
      <h3>Project in Ubiquitous Computing (2018)</h3>
      <p>The project consisted of designing, developing, and implementing our own Internet of Things technology. For the project, we identified a problem and designed a device with the intention of eliminating or reducing that problem. In this case, the problem consisted of empty coffee pots in a communal setting and the solution, a reminder-based, internet-connected coffee pot.

	<h3>Project in Human-Computer Interaction Requirements and Evaluation (2018)</h3>
		<p>
		The purpose of this project was to provide an in-depth analysis and evaluation of the application, Sleep as Android. Sleep as Android is more than just an average everyday alarm clock. At its core, Sleep as Android aims to wake a person up at the optimal time based on their current sleep cycle. Aside from tracking a person’s sleep, Sleep as Android employs a host of additional features from lullabies and sleep talk with snore recording, to creative ways to get a person out of bed along with smart watch integration. This project required extensive research done in verifying the usability of Sleep as Android along with its many features. It aims to provide validity to the proposed changes of the application through competitor and user research, user testing, and evaluation of potential redesigns for the key features identified through the research.
