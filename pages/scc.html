    <h2>About Smart Capital Center</h2>
    <p>Smart Capital Center is a company that provides financial services and investment solutions to individuals and businesses.

    <h2>My Work at Smart Capital Center</h2>
    <p>
        As part of my role at Smart Capital Center, I played a key role in designing the company’s website under the supervision of a lead UI designer. My primary responsibility was creating the initial mockups in Figma, translating business objectives into a clean, intuitive, and visually compelling interface. This process required a balance of aesthetics, functionality, and brand alignment to ensure the website resonated with the company’s audience.
        <br><br>
        To achieve this, we conducted extensive consultations with multiple stakeholders, including the CEO and the marketing team. The CEO had a clear vision for how the website should represent the company, and it was crucial that our design choices accurately reflected that intent. Through iterative design reviews and feedback loops, we refined the mockups, adjusting visual elements, messaging, and overall user experience to align with business priorities.
        <br><br>
        Beyond visual design, we focused on creating a seamless user journey that would engage visitors while effectively communicating Smart Capital Center’s value proposition. This involved careful consideration of layout, typography, color schemes, and interactive elements to ensure clarity and ease of navigation.
        <br><br>
        The final website successfully reinforced the company’s brand identity, provided a professional and engaging experience for users, and met the strategic goals set forth by leadership. This project not only strengthened my skills in UI/UX design and stakeholder collaboration but also deepened my understanding of how to translate business needs into functional, impactful digital experiences.
